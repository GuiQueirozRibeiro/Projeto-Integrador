# Project Description

This project was developed as part of the Integrative Project course in college, which was associated with the practice of data structures in the C language. Our group chose the theme of library and created a library management system. Our objective was to ensure the security of both customers and employees, so we used encryption to store all data and a separation between administrator users and clients so that each group has different permissions and functions, considering the role of each one. We also created a payment system, which, even without using real transactions, we developed a system using fake cards. Also the book are controlled by each user without affect any other.
